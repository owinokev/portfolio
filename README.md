Python program led me to a path that I never thought of, along the way passion for building programs has gone over the roof.
This is my porfolio that will be updated on a regular basis to bring out the best of where learning has driven me.
The files uploaded in the meantime will include Html Javascript and CSS(most done as inline)

Career and more so learning is a continous journey, we never arrive but we make tweaks on everything acquired to capture our progress.
